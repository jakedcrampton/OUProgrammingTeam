This GitHub repository is for OU's programming team to upload correct code for problems we've talked about in meetings or had in packets.

Some notes:
* **IMPORTANT**: IF you upload code, please make sure you've removed any inappropriate language or variable names.
* Submitted code MUST have received a "correct" judging from the website the problem came from if applicable. This is simply to ensure that people who come here looking to learn how to do a problem aren't mislead.
* Feel free to name the file "yourname".java or to put a description up top claiming yourself as the author. We don't mind a bit of clout chasing, since it promotes well-spirited competition.
*If you solve a problem using pre-programmed lists, don't upload megabytes of files please. Instead, also upload the program you used to generate those lists.
